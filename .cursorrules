# Cursor Rules for DaisyUI Integration

## DaisyUI Configuration
- This project uses DaisyUI 5 with Tailwind CSS 4
- DaisyUI is already installed and configured in the CSS file
- Use the llms.txt file for accurate DaisyUI component generation

## Code Generation Guidelines
- Always use DaisyUI class names when available
- Follow DaisyUI component patterns and syntax
- Use semantic color names (primary, secondary, accent, etc.) instead of Tailwind color names
- Apply responsive design using Tailwind responsive prefixes
- Use the component, part, style, behavior, color, size, placement, direction, and modifier class categories

## File References
- DaisyUI llms.txt: ./llms.txt
- DaisyUI documentation: https://daisyui.com
- Current CSS setup: @import "tailwindcss"; @plugin "daisyui";

## Best Practices
- Prefer DaisyUI components over custom CSS
- Use Tailwind utility classes for customization when needed
- Apply !important only as a last resort for CSS specificity issues
- Use placeholder images from https://picsum.photos/ when needed
- Follow Refactoring UI best practices for design decisions
